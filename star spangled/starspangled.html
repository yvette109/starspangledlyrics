	<h1> <u> Star Spangled Banner </u> </h1>
	<p> <br>   <br />
Oh, say can you see by the dawns early light <br />
What so proudly we hailed at the twilights last gleaming?<br />
Whose broad stripes and bright stars thru the perilous fight,<br />
Oer the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?<br />
And the rockets red glare, the bombs bursting in air,<br />
Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.<br />
Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave
Oer the land of the free and the home of the brave?<br />
